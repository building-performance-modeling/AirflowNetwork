description: "AirflowNetwork is a C++ implementation of the pressure network approach\
  \ to bulk air movement and contaminant transport, primarily in the context of buildings.\
  \ It is a descendant of NIST AIRNET (the precursor to NIST's CONTAM) and COMIS.\
  \ This modeling technique divides the building's total volume up into a set of well-mixed\
  \ zones that communicate via airflows through openings that are part of the building.\
  \ Parts of this code have been extracted from EnergyPlus (U.S. DOE's whole building\
  \ energy simulation program) and other parts are new development."
